      <p>
        I’m a full-stack software engineer at Atlas School in Tulsa, Oklahoma,
        with over ten years in customer service and three years in management
        and remote work. Currently in T5. After exploring fields like nursing and political
        science, I found my passion in technology, where I can solve real-world
        problems and stay inspired. I've always loved video games, so it's been
        amazing blending my love for them with other areas of technology. I’m
        skilled in team-building, problem-solving, and languages like C, Python,
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (my favorite!).
